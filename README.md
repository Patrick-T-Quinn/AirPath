# AirPath: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Traffic Management System

## Project Overview

AirPath is a structured traffic management system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in complex environments such as busy construction sites and dense urban areas. The primary goal is to facilitate safe and efficient UAV operations with minimal real-time coordination through a systematized approach to aerial navigation.

## Core Concepts

### Structured Airspace Design

- **Layered Horizontal Paths**: Single-direction pathways organized vertically at distinct altitudes
- **Looped Routes**: Horizontal paths designed as continuous loops, eliminating the need for in-path reversals
- **Vertical Transit Pillars**: Designated vertical conduits connecting different horizontal layers at junctions, allowing controlled vertical movement between layers
- **Discoverable Coordinates**: Network spatial information (paths, pillars, points of interest) readily accessible to participating UAVs

### Navigation Framework

- **Control Ranges**:
  - Long-range: Extended system-wide coordination
  - Medium-range: ~1km awareness and planning
  - Short-range: ~10m proximity operations
  - Immediate range: Direct collision avoidance

- **Path Traversal**: UAVs must obtain permission to traverse specific network segments between defined points
- **Segment Transit Timing**: Strict time limits (a few seconds) for traversing individual path segments
- **Loiter Zones**: Designated safe airspace where UAVs can temporarily wait if unable to proceed

### Field Management System

- **Field Definition**: A defined cuboid of controlled airspace with specified floor, ceiling, and lateral boundaries
- **Field Controller**: Designated authority responsible for all UAV traffic within a defined Field
- **Controller Discovery**: UAVs identify the appropriate Field Controller for their location using GPS coordinates and a lookup service
- **Managed Entry Protocol**: UAVs must request and receive permission before entering a Field

## Loiter Zone Design

Loiter zones are a critical component of the system, providing temporary holding areas for UAVs.

### Key Characteristics

- **Discrete Vertical Slots**: Each loiter zone consists of multiple pre-defined "loiter slots" with specific horizontal areas and vertical altitude bands
- **No Vertical Overlap**: Vertical separation between altitude bands ensures safe, rapid vertical descent in emergencies
- **Horizontal Buffers**: Space around each UAV accounts for station-keeping limits, environmental drift, and maneuvering space
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Traffic management system tracks slot status and dynamically assigns available slots to requesting UAVs

### Capacity Calculation

```
Capacity â‰ˆ Floor(Total Horizontal Area / Area per Slot) * Number of Vertical Levels
```

## Cargo Operations

AirPath facilitates cargo operations with standardized specifications:

- **Vehicle Orientation**: Cargo-bearing UAVs maintain specific orientation indicating door position
- **Standardized Equipment**: Equipped with standardized cargo rails for compatibility
- **Cargo Design**: Items designed to be manipulated via standardized side and top handles
- **Transfer Capabilities**: System facilitates cargo transfer between UAVs and to/from fixed infrastructure (docking bays, ground platforms)

## Visual Identification

UAVs within the system employ a standardized visual identification scheme:

- **High-Contrast Markings**: Alternating color chevrons (e.g., black/white, yellow/black) on top and bottom surfaces enhance visibility and aid in determining directionality
- **Low Light Visibility**: Retroreflective/photoluminescent materials and standardized active lighting (LEDs) for low-light and night operations
- **Machine Vision Optimization**: Patterns designed to be easily detectable and interpretable by automated machine vision systems
- **Distinctive Face Markings**: Different marking schemes for each of the six faces and docking doors

## Communication Requirements

AirPath prioritizes minimal coordination through standardized communication protocols:

### Core Communication Types

1. **System Information Acquisition**:
   - UAVs acquire network data (coordinates of paths, pillars, loiter zones, docking points)
   - Initial registration/authentication with a central authority

2. **Access Control & Path Allocation**:
   - Request entry to segments or pillars (Vehicle ID + Requested Entry Point)
   - Receive authorization response (Approved/Denied + potential Entry Time Window)

3. **Operational Handshakes**:
   - Confirm segment/pillar exit
   - Confirm entry/exit from docking or loiter zones

4. **Emergency & Alerting**:
   - High-priority, localized broadcasts for immediate hazards
   - System-wide alerts from the central authority

### Minimal Communication Interactions

- System Join (Registration)
- Network Acquisition (Data Download/Broadcast)
- Entry Request (Segment/Pillar)
- Authorization (Grant/Denial)
- Exit Confirmation (Segment/Pillar, Zones)
- Emergency Alerts

## Controller Responsibilities

Field Controllers actively manage traffic flow within their airspace:

- Assigning specific routes through the AirPath network
- Allocating resources like loiter zone slots or docking bay access
- Dynamically adjusting routes based on real-time conditions
- Facilitating inter-controller handoffs for journeys spanning multiple Fields

## Safety Features

- **Collision Avoidance**: Integrated systems as a fundamental safety component
- **Standardized Visual Identification**: Ensuring UAVs are recognizable by both humans and machines
- **Structured Pathways**: Design minimizes conflict potential
- **Emergency Protocols**: Procedures for managing system failures or unexpected events

## Implementation Considerations

- **Scalability**: System designed to accommodate increasing UAV traffic density
- **Interoperability**: Standardized protocols to ensure compatibility across different UAV types and manufacturers
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Framework aligned with evolving air traffic management regulations
- **Human-System Integration**: Interface considerations for human operators and observers

## Use Cases

AirPath is specifically designed for:

- **Urban Delivery Networks**: Facilitating last-mile delivery in dense city environments
- **Construction Sites**: Coordinating multiple UAVs for inspection, delivery, and monitoring tasks
- **Emergency Response**: Organizing multiple aerial vehicles during disaster response
- **Infrastructure Inspection**: Managing routine automated inspection of large-scale infrastructure
